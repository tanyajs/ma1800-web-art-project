Hello,
https://tanyajs.github.io/ma1800-web-art-project/


My project idea is interactive scrolling and clickable gifs that lead to website links and other pages depending on what gif you have clicked, however some of the gifs do not have links so you would have to test it out when clicking on a random one (the first line down of gifs have links until you see it is repeated you may need to press on the rest to see if they have a link). The coding for this is quite repetitive since the gifs are repeated when you're scrolling therefore id have to copy and paste the code to have the gifs scrolling for longer down the page. The context behind this project is that you are scrolling for a few seconds and then reach the end of the page to press 'continue' but there's no actual reward for scrolling, in simple terms its meant to reflect on how people scroll on social media with no actual purpose at the end. 

The challenges i faced during this project is the layout. I had trouble at first on how i should put the gifs and if it was easier for me to do it the way i did it because ive never used this type of code before. It was kinda difficult to think about what the other pages should have only because i was going to stick to one page which was the continue button page but then that would lack since it would only be one page. Therefore, with the help of feedback i then make the website links on some of the gifs and then extra pages for when you press a certain gif too. 

Work that influenced me during the seminars was https://www.petracortright.com/ this project is what stood out to me and inspired me to do this project. i wouldnt have had the idea of scrolling if i didnt see this so it really did help with my project idea so then i made the idea into my own aesthetic and then during the project i came up with the theme. During one of the weeks i really liked the idea of the gradient which changes when you scroll to make it less boring when youre scrolling. 

If i had more time for this project the gifs would all be different and not repeated and they would all link to either a website link or a page meaning i would have used more pages and in those pages would be different animations or more creative style. Overall i would have tried to add more creativity in the different pages and what the gifs linked to as well as the text i think i wouldve made the text move and change it up to stand out more. 

The list of gifs are all from

https://gifcity.carrd.co/#buttons
https://gifcity.carrd.co/#graphics

these gifs are what really brought my project together and was really useful.
